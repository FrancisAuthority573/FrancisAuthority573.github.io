<h2>Introduction to c++</h2>
<p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as
an extension to the C language.<br></p>
<p>C++ is close to C but the difference between the both is that, C does not support object and classes while C++ do support classes and object.</p>

<h2>Installation and setting up the C++ IDE</h2>
<p>An IDE is an acronym of Integrated Development Environment. It can be a software for coding and programming that interprets or compile any code with a compiler or interpreter.</p>
<p>C++ uses a popular compiler which is GCC. In installing and setting up your IDE you need to have a text editor like notepad++ where you can write all the codes and a compiler like GCC for compiling the code which gives the result or output.</p>
<p>There are many text editors and compilers but we will be using and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which we will use to write and run the code.</p>
<p>The C++ IDEs which are popular are Visual Studio, Dev c++, Eclipse, code::block, etc. But we are going to be using Dev c++.</p>
<p>If you don't have Dev c++ you can download it from <a href="https://devc++.org/download/">here</a>, or use another C++ IDE like Visual Studio or code::block.
